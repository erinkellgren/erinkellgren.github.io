		<h2>About the Film</h2>
		<p>In the stillness after conflict, after the blood dries and the screams fade, the memory of violence transforms survivors into prisoners of their own pain. How do whole societies recover from devastating conflict? Can survivors live—converse, smile, and even laugh—beside someone who blinded them, killed their parents, or murdered their children? Can victims and perpetrators work together to rebuild their lives? This life-changing documentary explores the intersections of justice and forgiveness as survivors heal from these tragedies.</p>
		<p>We are proud that Beyond Right & Wrong has reached so many people through its many screenings—from large events for international audiences to smaller gatherings for local communities. We are also incredibly grateful to the organizations and film festivals that have recognized and supported Beyond Right & Wrong and its life-changing message.  In its short time in the public eye, Beyond Right & Wrong received great reviews from critics and from viewers who were deeply touched by the film’s hopeful message on reconciliation and recovery. The links to the right offer a selection of these screenings and reviews.</p>
